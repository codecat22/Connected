# Connected (Or some other fancy name)
Second shorter project for the Advanced Graphics and Interaction (AGI21) course. We create a VR experience for learning about and playing with logical or electrical circuits. Similar to programming applications like logisim, we want users to be able to create and solve electrical/logical problems in an immersive virtual environment.
